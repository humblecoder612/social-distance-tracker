# Social Distance Tracker
> ML/AI applied to Calculate distance between people 
We used YOLO v4 to determine peoples locations and used opencv techniques to calculate distance in x-y coordinates and camera optic study for z coordinates with some maths to scale the results and it's pretty much accuracte around 70-90 %.
